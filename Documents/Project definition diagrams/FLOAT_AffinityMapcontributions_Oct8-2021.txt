For our affinity map, we split our project ideas into different aspects:
1. UI - Ideas for what we want for the user interface that we/others will interact with
2. AI - Ideas for what we will use to operate and train our AI
3. Design - Ideas for our physical and software design concepts of the project
4. Planning - Ideas for how we plan to test our project in early and future stages

Phase 1
We brainstormed different ideas for the project based on the 4 categories as outlined.

Phase 2
We grouped any ideas together in subcategories to get us thinking of the different
aspects of the project we would focus. We then added a bit more ideas now that we have some
defined subcategories.
